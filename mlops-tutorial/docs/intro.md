# Welcome to Zero-to-Hero MLOps

Master Kubernetes, infrastructure automation, and machine learning operations in 9 progressive phases.

## What You'll Learn

This comprehensive tutorial takes you from zero to expert in ML/LLMOps:

- **Phase 1**: Kubernetes Foundations (6-8 hours)
- **Phase 2**: Infrastructure as Code (4-6 hours)
- **Phase 3**: Chaos Engineering & Diagnostics (4-5 hours)
- **Phase 4**: Autonomous Self-Healing (5-6 hours)
- **Phase 5**: Model Training Pipeline (8-10 hours)
- **Phase 6**: GPU Scheduling & Cost Optimization (6-8 hours)
- **Phase 7**: AutoML & Hyperparameter Tuning (6-8 hours)
- **Phase 8**: Distributed Training - Simulation (4-6 hours)
- **Phase 9**: Distributed Training - Production (6-8 hours)

**Total**: 40-60 hours spread over 4-8 weeks

## Target Audience

- Intermediate developers (Python, Docker basics, heard of Kubernetes)
- Want to learn infrastructure automation
- Interested in machine learning operations
- Prefer hands-on labs over theory

## What Makes This Different

✅ **100% Local**: Run on your laptop with Kind (Kubernetes in Docker)
✅ **No Cloud Costs**: Everything free, no AWS/GCP/Azure needed
✅ **Tablet-Friendly**: Read theory on your tablet, practice on your laptop
✅ **Progressive**: Each phase builds on previous ones
✅ **Hands-On**: 40+ labs with validation checkpoints
✅ **AI-Powered**: Connect AI agents to automate infrastructure

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

- **Docker Desktop** or **Rancher Desktop** installed and running
- **Terminal/CLI** comfort (basic commands: cd, ls, cat)
- **Python 3.10+** installed
- **4GB RAM** and **20GB disk space**
- **2-3 hours** uninterrupted time per session (or split into smaller chunks)

## Getting Started

Ready to dive in? Start with **[Phase 1: Kubernetes Foundations](./phase1/index.md)**

It's recommended to work through phases sequentially, as each builds on previous knowledge.

## FAQ

**Q: Do I need cloud experience?**
A: No! This teaches you everything from scratch.

**Q: Can I do this on a Mac with Apple Silicon?**
A: Yes! All instructions include macOS (ARM64) support.

**Q: What if I only have 2GB RAM?**
A: Kind clusters can run on 2GB, but 4GB+ recommended for comfort.

**Q: Can I run this on Windows?**
A: Absolutely! Full Windows (PowerShell) instructions provided.

**Q: How long does this take?**
A: 40-60 hours total, typically 4-8 weeks at a reasonable pace.
